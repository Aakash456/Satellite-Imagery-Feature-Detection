Satellite Image Detection
The rapid increase of satellite imagery has given us a drastically improved understanding of our planet. 
It has empowered us to all the more likely accomplish everything from mobilizing resources during disasters to monitoring effects of global warming. 
What is frequently underestimated is that advancements such as these have relied on labeling features of significance like building footprints and roadways fully by hand or through imperfect semi-automated methods.
As these huge, complex datasets keep on expanding exponentially in number, the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is looking for novel answers for reduce the weight on their picture investigators.
